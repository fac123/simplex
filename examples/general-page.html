          <p>A ceremony marking the completion of the First Transcontinental
          Railroad was held at Promontory Summit in the Utah Territory on May
          10, 1869. The route, formed by the joining of the Central Pacific
          Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad, enabled passenger and freight
          trains to travel between the east and west coasts of North America and
          was immensely beneficial to the development of the western United States.
          To commemorate the occasion, a 17.6-karat gold final spike was driven
          in by Leland Stanford to connect the rails of both lines.</p>

          <p>"Faces" is an episode of the American science fiction television
          series Star Trek: Voyager. First broadcast by UPN in May 1995, it was
          developed from a story by Jonathan Glassner and Kenneth Biller. Set in
          the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet
          and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they are stranded in
          the Delta Quadrant.</p>
          <p>He creates two clones, human Torres and Klingon Torres, to serve as
          test subjects; these were treated as two separate characters during
          the development and filming of the episode. The episode was developed
          as a character study to further explore Torres' internal struggle with
          her identity. Dawson (pictured) said that it deepened her
          understanding of the character and strengthened her acting.</p>

          <p>The National Gallery is an art museum in Trafalgar Square in the
          City of Westminster, in Central London. Founded in 1824, it houses a
          collection of over 2,300 paintings dating from the mid-13th century
          to 1900.</p>

          <p>The Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public
          body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Its collection
          belongs to the government on behalf of the British public, and entry
          to the main collection is free of charge.</p>

          <p>Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National
          Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely
          art collection. It came into being when the British government bought
          38 paintings from the heirs of John Julius Angerstein in 1824.</p>
          <p>After that initial purchase the Gallery was shaped by its early
          directors, notably Sir Charles Lock Eastlake, and by private donations,
          which today account for two-thirds of the collection. The collection
          is small compared with many European national galleries, but
          encyclopaedic in scope; most major developments in Western painting
          are represented with important works.</p>
          <h4>Heading level 4</h4>
          <p>It used to be claimed that this was one of the few national
          galleries that had all its works on permanent exhibition, but this is
          no longer the case.</p>
